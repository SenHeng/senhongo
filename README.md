Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sen Hongo and I'm a freelance software engineer helping companies build prototypes and bring products to market, most recent ones being [fundbook](https://fundbook.co.jp) and [Strap](https://product.strap.app). 

Currently (2022), I'm helping [aeco](https://aeco.co.jp) with a new service that I hope to introduce soon.
