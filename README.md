Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sen Hongo and I'm a freelance software engineer helping companies build prototypes and bring products to market. I'm currently (2023-03) helping [aeco] bring [Chubic] to life! Previously I've also worked on [fundbook](https://fundbook.co.jp) and [Strap](https://product.strap.app). I'm involved in all phases, from the initial ideation to user research and testing, UI and UX design, systems design and finally, writing the code that makes the magic happen!
