Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sen Hongo and I'm a freelance software engineer helping companies build prototypes and bring products to market, most recent ones being [fundbook](https://fundbook.co.jp) and [Strap](https://product.strap.app). I'm involved in all phases, from the initial ideation to user research and testing, UI and UX design, systems design and finally, writing the code that makes the magic happen!

Currently (2022), I'm helping [aeco](https://aeco.co.jp) with a new service that I hope to introduce soon.
